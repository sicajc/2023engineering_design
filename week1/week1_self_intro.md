# Self Introduction
- Audience: Bunches of students that is in similiar age as your age.
- Goal: Leave an impression on them.

## Strategy
1. Make some common well known jokes about things, for instance, Hsinchu big city, naming joke, metaphor of your own personality, unexpected stuff about yourself, the jokes shall be tested and well prepared.
2. The presentation should not contain too much details but only a few slides, slightly present the point of joke you want to present, slightly present your hobby if it can impress others and make connections.
3. To make a metaphor, you can think of yourself as an animal, what kind of animal suits you the most? Why does it suit you?
4. Impression includes the element of surprise and jokes.
5. You shall give your presentation loudly to let people hear you, with mask included, you should make it even louder.
6. Coach potatoes.

## Remake self introduction
1. People usually refer me as a sloth(place a picture of a sloth), because I usually need tons of sleep and tends to daydream(Place a picture of sleepiness) during the class and work. Daydreaming about midterm and final all pass~
2. I am from Taipei(Place a meme about Taipei), live at country edge Beitou(Point to the edge in Taipei), and as a vacational hot spring site(No hot spring ok?), there is no hot spring at my house, please stop asking me about that.
3. Since I just get to Hsinchu recently, and would like to know where can I have a leisure in the weekend. Every tells me to go to Big City(Big City)~ The one and only place for leisure. Thus I went there by my bike, that is the first time and last time I would go to Big City.
4. Nowadays, I ride the bicycle to NYCU and swim everyday, if I include jogging into my routine, I might be able to train for triathlon at Hsinchu(Place a picture of triathlon). Train for traithlon while doing research.

# What should not be done?
- Remain silent and give presentation in a low volume.
- Make no preparation for the talk, since you do not have enough self-esteem to give a presentation unprepared.
- Talk about your research and waste the time for you to impress others.
- To give a talk, you must first clarify the goal of your talk. The audience, venue and hardware. For self introduction, you are here to make impression to others.
