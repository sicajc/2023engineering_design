# Dissertation
## Brain storming
1. Representing the Lab, the professor, the graduate school, thus formality matters as a graduate student.

2. Talking about your dissertation, the value of your thesis, the analysis results of your thesis, how do you win against state of art? What kind of vision do you have during the research process.

3. The value of your thesis, details of your experimental result becomes important. Comparison works the best here. S.t. value can be presented.

4. Name and reputation of the lab must be considered. The logo of lab should be presented.

5. Introduction, comparison results and conclusion matters the most! The goal is to quickly demonstrate the value of your work to the audience.

6. Depends on the handout you presented to the professor,professor already has the handouts, usually graph and chart with details should be added to the ppt.

## Goal
- Representing the lab, quickly convey the value of your paper through introduction(why doing this paper?), comparison with charts and your results, and the conclusion of your experimental results, s.t. value can be demonstrated.
- Formality matters a lot here, since you are representing your lab and school.

## Structures
1. Your lab, your school, your research.
2. Index for jumping back and forth between different slides.
3. Still gives the target you want to achieve, what you want to do in this research?
4. Talk about the conclusion of your work, research background is not important since the professor you are talking to is already the profession of the field.
5. Then starts telling how you got this conclusion by using comparison models and graph and charts.
6. Talk about the conclusion again and add some future works into your presentation.
